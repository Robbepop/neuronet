TODO Liste:

- make NeuralNet, NeuralLayer, NeuralConnection and Neuron copyable and movable.
- make NeuralNets serializable to output them to a stream and construct them via a stream.
- make execution of feedForward and backPropagation paralellized.
- remove Neuron's reference to its NeuralLayer as it isn't really required. (more cache efficiency!)
- add some helper methods to forward execution from NeuralNet to NeuralLayer.
